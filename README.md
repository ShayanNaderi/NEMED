*"Nemed"*, of the [Irish legend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemed), "was the leader of the third group of people to settle in Ireland".

Although this tool adopts the acronym NEMED to represent "National Electricity Market Emissions Data", a python package to retrieve and process historical emissions data of the NEM from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). Also not to confuse the spelling of NEMDE, the "NEM Dispatch Engine".


## Ongoing Development
This package is a work in progress. It may not suit all applications and importantly has not been thoroughly tested or verified against formal emissions reporting by NGERs and AEMO.

## Installation
```bash
pip install nemed
```
